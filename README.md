# T-Matrix Data Format

This repository is part  of the project aimed at establishing a common data format to store the electromagnetic scattering response using the T-matrix formalism. It contains files for generation and storage of T-matrices in hdf5 format using various software, following the structure specifications described in a dedicated document. Additionally, `terms` and `treams` are multiscattering codes that have the capability to load the files in this format and compute optical quantities for a single or multiple scatterers. 

The example hdf5 files are located in the example_data directory. The analytically computed asymmetric tetrahedron of spheres is contained in the reference_data directory, which is useful for checking the normalization.
