To use the NANOBEM toolbox, you must add at the beginning of each session
the main directory and all subdirectories to the Matlab path, e.g. by calling

  >> addpath(genpath(NANOBEMDIR) );

Here, NANOBEMDIR is the *full* directory name of the toolbox.

To set up the NANOBEM help pages, you must install them once.  
To this end, you must

  (1)  change in Matlab to the main directory of the NANOBEM toolbox, and
  (2)  run the file makehelp.
  
A detailed help of the Toolbox and a number of demo files are then 
available in the Matlab help pages which can be found on the start page 
of the help browser under Supplemental Software.
