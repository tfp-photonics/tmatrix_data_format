## Examples 
Currently, all the example data is computed with JCMsuite FEM solver.
- Gold spheroid in water (n=1.33): semiminor axis = 20 nm, semimajor axis = 40 nm
- TiO2 cylinder (n=2.5) in vacuum: radius is 250 nm, height equals 300 nm
- Anisotropic cuboid ($n_{xx}$ = 1.8, $n_{yy} = 2, n_{zz}$ = 2.2) in vacuum: length is 250 nm, width is 200 nm, and height equals 150 nm
- Silver helix in vacuum: winding number is 2.5, radius of the tube is 21.25 nm, pitch is 200 nm, radius of the helix equals 41.25 nm
